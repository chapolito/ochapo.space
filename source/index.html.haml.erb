      %p.intro Our story begins on St. Patrick’s day in 2008. It was a wednesday evening of finals week and a group of seniors from <abbr>UCSD</abbr> were meeting up for drinks&hellip;
      %p &hellip;oh wait&hellip;actually they met a few months before that at a dinner party at Caito’s house. Jesse arrived late and although his best efforts to engage her in conversation, there was an immenient game of monopoly winning her attention. Needless to say, only Jesse remembers that meeting.
      %p So back to St. Patricks day at $1 beer night. This time Jesse redoubled his efforts and was remembered! Not only that, he was invited to a party in just a couple days at her house. The party was when they really hit it off and were together since.

      %p.intro After both graduating from <abbr>UCSD</abbr> in art, Jesse continued designing while Caito took a different path and became a labor and delivery nurse. Their careers diverged but they have continued to create, build, make, and destroy. By crafting their own furniture and art for their walls, they have begun to build a home together. 
      %p Besides art, they share many interests like Grapefruit Sculpin, Game of Thrones, and contemplating the vast, cold, and lonely vacuum that is space. Their greatest passion, though, is the sea. It has provided delicious dinners, magical underwater moments, and most importantly, barrels for Jesse and noserides for Caito.
      %p During the last few winters they have traveled to southern baja for warm waves and diving with whale sharks and bull sharks (don’t worry, they’re still in one piece). And this November they will return again to start their married lives doing the thing they love most, surfing!

      %p.intro It had been a long tiring week of delivering babies for Caito so Jesse suggested date night at their favorite restaurant, Whisknladle. Just to sweeten the deal, Jesse let Caito pick out a place to watch the sunset before. Of course she picked Slides, their favorite lookout spot at La Jolla Cove.
      %p To up the romance, Jesse brought along a bottle of bourbon-barrel aged Narwhal (arguably the best stout known to man). This date was shaping up to be the best date ever! So they drank their delicious beer and enjoyed the view and the company. 
      %p But then&hellip;Jesse walked to the edge and called out, “Caito, come check out this seal!” (such a  sneaky guy). As Caito got close, he dropped to one knee and popped the question. Of course, she screamed YES! Hiding in the bushes, a photographer captured the magical moment. They were both as happy as can be and celebrated with one of the best meals of their life (or maybe it was the bubblies and giddiness).
