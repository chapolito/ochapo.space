        ### Getting to Todos Santos

        <img src="/images/info-to-be-known/space-shuttle.svg" height="300" class="gutter-image">

        ##### Flying In
        
        We recommend flying into San Jose del Cabo (about 1 hour, 15 minutes from Todos). Alternately, you can fly into La Paz (about ten minutes closer), but there are limited direct flights from the <abbr>US</abbr>. 

        ##### Rent a Car
        
        Although there are shuttles or taxis that can get you to Todos, a car is necessary to navigate from the town to the beach. Reserve your rental ahead of time because when you walk out of the airport, there will be 30+ car rental agents hassling for your business. When you exit the airport, look for the guy holding a sign for your rental company. I have used Cactus in the past.

        ##### Directions to Todos 
        
        Now there is a wonderful new toll road that bypasses Cabo San Lucas!

          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-left-turn.svg'
          When exiting the airport, turn left. Look for signage saying <abbr>CUOTA</abbr>.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-ticket.svg'
          Proceed to the first toll-booth. Press the red button for a printed ticket.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-fork.svg'
          The first fork in the road you encounter will be for <abbr>SAN JOSE</abbr> or <abbr>CABO</abbr>. Take the <strong><abbr>CABO</abbr></strong> option.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-fork.svg'
          The next (and last) fork you come to will give you the option of <abbr>CABO</abbr> or <abbr>TODOS SANTOS</abbr>. Take <strong><abbr>TODOS SANTOS</abbr></strong>.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-money.svg'
          When you reach the tollbooth, relinquish your ticket and pay $70 pesos (or the <abbr>USD</abbr> equivalent).
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-highway-19.svg'
          You will then merge with the main highway <abbr>(MEXICO 19 NORTH)</abbr> and be on your way to Todos Santos.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-right-turn.svg'
          On entering Todos Santos on Calle Degollado: Drive across the stop-light, after stop light turn right onto Calle Juarez. This is the main street with Hotel California.

        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-hotel.svg'
          Take Topete out of town. You will pass Hotel Guaycura on your left.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-left-turn.svg'
          As you come uphill, turn left at the “T” on Horizonte.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-coffee.svg'
          You will pass La Esquina on your left and then later a colorful elementary school on your right.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-right-turn.svg'
          At the stop sign, turn right (follow sign to Batiquitos). 
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-market.svg'
          A mile or so up the road, a mini supermarket, El Sol II, will be on the left. Great place to buy beer &amp; chips, limited selection of produce.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-left-turn.svg'
          Continue on the road until it becomes unpaved and then take your first left at Camino Viejo before the road dips down. Pachamama will be on your right side. Look for the white house and tepees.

        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-palms.svg'
          See above for directions out of town. Continue on the dirt road past Pachamama and past the palm tree farm.
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-left-turn.svg'
          On your left, you will see two small unmarked dirt roads that come together and lead to a wide open sandy lot. 
        %li
          =image_tag 'images/info-to-be-known/directions/directions-wave.svg'
          Park anywhere on the hard sand. Careful not to get your tires stuck or bury your keys in the sand and forget where (Caito made that mistake).

        ### Where to stay
        
        ##### Hotel 
        
        If you want to stay in town, we recommend Hotel Guaycura. They have several room options and a roof-top pool and bar. You can walk to everything in town but will need a car to get to the beach. 

        ##### Casitas
        
        There are many houses and casitas to rent on Airbnb and <abbr>VRBO</abbr> just outside of town and closer to the beach and surf break. You will need a car to drive into town. 
    
       
        ### About Todos
        
        Designated a Pueblo Magico, this quaint surfer/artist town is dotted with galleries, artisan shops, and great restaurants. But what really makes it magical to us is the white sand beach and beautiful warm waves. We will probably be spending most of our time in the water and on the beach and we hope you will join us. But don’t forget to enjoy the rest of the town too. Below are some suggestions:

        ##### Eat
        
        - **La Esquina**: Great coffee and healthy breakfast/lunch, veggie options, “craft” Mexican beer
        - El Poblano: Killer al pastor and carne asada tacos 
        - El Zaguan: Quaint restaurant with delicious seafood
        - Landis: Cute patio at night, great appetizer sampler
        - La Casita: Great fish and sushi
        - Sante Fe: Italian ?
        - La Morena: Mexican/Cuban food with tasty cocktails
        
        ##### Drink
        
        - La Bodega: Baja wine shop with wine tasting. They are only open a few days a week so walk by the shop and check their schedule. Sometimes they have live music and you can order food from next door. 
        - Tequila Sunrise: Great margaritas
        - Kins Mojito and Martini Bar: Todos Santos is a sleepy town at night but Kins stays open until 1am Mon-Sat
        
        ##### Culture
        
        - [Check out some art](https://todossantos.cc/art-galleries/)
        - Cultural Center “Centro Cultural”: Historical library and museum with nationalist and revolutionary murals from 1933

        
        ### If you have extra vacation time
        
        ##### Whale sharks in La Paz
        
        1 hour east on the Sea of Cortez lies the marina city La Paz. There you can find several snorkel tours with whale sharks. These beautiful gentle giants love hanging out at the surface feeding on plankton and posing for snorkelers. 

        ##### Fishing, diving, and snorkeling in Cabo Pulmo
        
        About a two hour drive from Cabo, south of La Paz, is Cabo Pulmo, an amazing marine reserve. Our diving adventures here have included turtles, bull sharks and schooling big eye jacks. The place is teeming with life and great visibility.
