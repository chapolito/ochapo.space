        ###Saturday

        ####1/2 Beach Day 
        To start our wedding day off right, we will begin the day with a morning surf. Join us in the water or on the beach. 
        
        ####The Wedding!
        The Wedding will be at Pachamama. Please arrive at 4:00 PM. Shuttles will be provided, more info on that later.

        ######Dress
        Nice but not too nice, we like to say "Beach Classy". Ceremony will be on the beach, a short walk from Pachamama on the sand—sandals are encouraged, heels are not. 

        ######Reception
        A fiesta filled with laughter, drinks, dancing, &amp; tacos will follow the ceremony at the beach.


        ###Sunday 
        
        ####Adiós Brunch
        Swing by Pachamama to say your goodbyes and cure your hangover with a Mexican pastry and coffee. 

        ####Beach Day
        If you plan on hanging around for the whole day you’ll find us on the beach in the afternoon.

        ###Monday

        ####Gene Turns 70!
        That's right! **Eugene David Chapo** will be celebrating his 70<sup>th</sup> trip around the sun! We'll be asking him to recall stories of his childhood and telling us all how cheap gas used to be ;) Just Kidding Dad, we love you! Details of the celebration are forthcoming.
